This repository contains code for exploring just intonation via the lattice model of harmonic space. Specifically included are: 
- Tools for procedurally generating lists of unique pitch collections.
- a set of utilities for measuring aspects of the spatial structures of these pitch collections as represented on the lattice. 
- a series of plotting tools for veiwing these pitch collections in various representations (2d lattice, 3d lattice, tree diagram, layer slices.
